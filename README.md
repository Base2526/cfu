## FAQ

- How did you calculate the distance between the origin and the destination?

    Ans - Using the haversine function which determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Haven't used any API for this yet.

- Do I have to give my real details to check the RazorPay Booking Payment feature?

    Ans - **NO**. Just give any dummy values for the payment fields as it is running in Test Mode. Booking ID will be generated after Fake Payment.
